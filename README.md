# GEM-RES-MUR: An integrated metabolic profiling for GEM using RAS and MUR for Human Bone Osteosarcoma
This repository contains genome-scale metabolic models for different nutrient availability of Human Bone Osteosarcoma. All GEMs were obtained after applying our GEM-based metabolic profiling framework using metabolic gene expression data and information about nutrients.

# Content
This repository contains the following data:
- `genes`: Gene expression data (featureCounts) for seven nutrient availability conditions.
- `RAS`: Reaction Activity Score data for seven nutrient availability conditions.
- `GEMs`: Final GEMs (based on Recon3D) for seven nutrient availability conditions.
